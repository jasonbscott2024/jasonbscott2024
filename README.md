Welcome to my GitHub page! I'm Jason Scott, and in early 2024 I completed a Master of Science in Data Science. During my studies I focused heavily on analytics. I'm currently employed as a Business Intelligence Analyst at a fortune 500 company. What you may find on my GitHub page are: projects that I've
worked on during the course of my graduate studies, and some personal projects that I'm currently working on.
  
While most of this page is continuosly being designed to showcase my knowledge and skills as an analyst, you may also find some AI projects as I have
a passion for machine learning as well. 

If you would like to contact me, you may reach me at: jason.scott3024@gmail.com
